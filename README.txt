Product name: Rhythm Master

Description: Rhythm Master is an application designed to make learning musical instruments more accessible and fun for those who may think that to be a daunting task. We achieve this through the use of tools such as built-in AI coaches that give real-time, constructive feedback to learners, as well as other musicians who are able to post courses/tutorials of their own.
